I'm glad you've visited my personal website. It is built around the idea of technical blog - a repository of solutions to some of the interesting programming problems that I've come across.

Not surprisingly, the concept was born out of my own needs. I've used to note down hacky ways to deal with extraordinary issues, so in case of bumping into one of them again, I have the solution at ready.

My "notepad" started to grow in size rapidly when I've taken on side-projects, aimed at developing my programming skills and learning emerging technologies. I thought that it is a perfect opportunity to share it with the rest of the coders out there. Active community, whose members are eager to help each other and learn collectively, underlies the success of the discipline.

On the other side, this site is meant to be the extension of my [LinkedIn profile](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/przemyslawwozniak) - another way of building what's called a "personal brand" and my credibility as a software engineer specialist.
